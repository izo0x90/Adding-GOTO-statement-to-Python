# Adding GOTO statement into Python

"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should." - That JURASSIC PARK guy

You guys remember basic.

Just what it sounds like, a decorator that patches the bytecode of a decorated function to allow variable assignments to specific string constants to be treated as GOTO/JUMP statements and LABELS to jump to.

Just in case it needs to be said, yes this is a joke and has no actual uses, nor should anyone use it for anything real other than having fun.

All relevant code in main.py.

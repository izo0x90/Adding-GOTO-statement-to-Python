# Adding GOTO statement into Python

[GOTO Considered harmful](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf) by Edgar Dijkstra

"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should." - That JURASSIC PARK guy

You guys remember basic.

Just what it sounds like, a decorator that patches the bytecode of a decorated function to allow variable assignments to specific string constants to be treated as GOTO/JUMP statements and LABELS to jump to.

Just in case it needs to be said, yes this is a joke and has no actual uses, nor should anyone use it for anything real other than having fun.

![XKCD Comic, GOTO](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/goto.png)

All relevant code in main.py. 

Use:
```Python
@goto_mutator            # << Decorate func you want to patch GOTOs into with mutator
some_func():
  pass                   #   << Do regular stuff
  pass
  pass 
  x = "#GOTO_mylabel"    #   << This is the goto statement, var name does not matter,
                                statement has to be a string const, 
                                starting with keyword #GOTO_ after that label name
  pass
  pass
  pass                     # <<  Do more regular stuff, of course after patching 
                               the goto statemet will skip right over this secion
                              
  x = "#GOTOLABEL_mylabel" # << This is the LABEL we will that will be jumped to
  pass 
  pass                     # << Keep doing stuff 
```
You should be able to define as many jumps and labels as desired, mutator will build a map and patch in jumps.
